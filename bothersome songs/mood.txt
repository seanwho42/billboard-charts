[Intro: 24kGoldn]
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah

[Verse 1: iann dior]
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow, I always end up feelin' bad
Baby, I am not your dad
It's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we arguin' in my bedroom
[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
So why you tryna feign your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me
[Pre-Chorus: iann dior, iann dior & 24kGoldn]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
