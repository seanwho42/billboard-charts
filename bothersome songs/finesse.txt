[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (Wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (Aha)
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (You see me?)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (Shook)
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked (Hooked)
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (Ha)
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like
Ayy, hit the Lil Jon
Okay (Okay), okay (Okay)
Oh, yeah, we drippin' in finesse and gettin' paid, ow

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long (All night long, woo)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I walk in with you (When I walk in with you)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (Baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (No)
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
Now, slow it down for me, baby (Slow it down, girl)
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind (When we grind), yeah
Our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I walk in with you (When I walk in with you)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (Baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (No)
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it (Woo)

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life (Woo)
Ladies, grab your fellas and let's do this right (Do this right)
If you're on one like me and mine (Ow)

Don't it feel so good to be us? Ayy

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Cardi B]
We out here drippin' in finesse (We drippin' on 'em)
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse with my baby
It don't make no sense (Oh-oh)
Out here drippin' in finesse (Yeah, yeah)
You know it, you know it (Girl, you know we got it goin' on)

[Outro: Cardi B, Bruno Mars, Bruno Mars & Cardi B]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? Ayy
